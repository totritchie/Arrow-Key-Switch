ArrowKeySwitch is a utility designed to modify your keyboard's functionality, allowing users to utilize the I, J, K, L keys as arrow keys when pressing the CapsLock key.

The project was created using AutoHotkey, a powerful scripting language that allows you to write keyboard macros while consuming minimal computer resources.

ArrowKeySwitch was originally created to combat tendonitis in my right wrist.  The discomfort worsened due to the constant transition between the home row and the arrow keys. This solution was borne out of a necessity for improved office ergonomics. It has been a significant relief for me, and I hope it proves beneficial for others as well.

Installation:

  Download ArrowKeySwitch1.0.exe from this repository.
  Save the executable to your preferred location on your computer.
  Double-click ArrowKeySwitch1.0.exe to run the utility. Note: This program will not provide a traditional user interface. Instead, it will appear in your system tray with a green "H" symbol (representing AutoHotkey).
  If you wish for the utility to start up automatically, refer to this guide: How to run apps automatically at startup in Windows 10.
  
Editing and Contributing:

  Download and install AutoHotKey v2.0.
  Download the ArrowKeySwitch.ahk script.
  Modify the script to suit your preferences.
  Double-click the ArrowKeySwitch.ahk script to run.
  
Functionality:

  CapsLock works as expected.
  Press CapsLock with I, J, K, or L to emulate the arrow keys. Doing this will also deactivate the CapsLock function to ensure smooth typing.
  
Word Navigation:

  Press Ctrl + CapsLock with the J or L key to move the cursor to the start of the current or previous word.

  Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests for enhancements or bug fixes. Feedback and suggestions are always appreciated.

Future Work/Limitations:

  I aim to enhance the program to support MS Excel, as it currently lacks robust functionality in this application.
  The utility does NOT support highlighting text when combined with the Shift key.
